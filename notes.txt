Notes:

Near future:

what we want:
    use only one device
    select one device
    display devices connected
    open a device


Create make file:
    run lsmod "unload"

Create git allow:
    *.txt
    c,h

Autogenetate h files on save using vscode


Future:

To have a device object to interact
Create methods to interact with object
    What methods do I need to interact with i2c?
        receive data
            identify fields
        Dump current device settings
Process data
Display data
